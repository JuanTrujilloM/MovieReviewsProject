    <p>
      This web application is a movie review platform developed using Django. It allows users to view a curated list of movies, each with detailed information including title, description, poster image, and an optional external link for more information.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the key features of the application is the ability to search for movies by name using a dynamic search bar. The results are displayed in a visually organized format using Bootstrap cards.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project was developed as part of a hands-on workshop focused on using Git, GitHub, Python, and Django. Throughout the process, good development practices were applied such as version control with branches, commits, and merges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Media handling was configured to allow uploading and displaying custom images for each movie. All data is stored using Djangoâ€™s built-in SQLite database and managed through the Django admin interface.
